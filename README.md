# mleftright

mleftright package for LaTeX


TeX sets subformulas by \left and \right as inner formulas
with additional surrounding spaces in some situations. This package
provides \mleft and \mright that call \left and \right,
but the delimiters will act as normal \mathopen and \mathclose
delimiters without the additional space of an inner formula.
